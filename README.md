# AI Readiness Score  \n\nThis repository contains the initial specification and build plan for the AI Readiness Score tool. The goal of this project is to provide a standardized score (0–100) that rates how well a website is prepared to be consumed and understood by AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs). This score will be continuously updated as best practices evolve.  \n\n## Vision  \n\nThe AI Readiness Score tool helps agencies and website owners prepare their sites for an AI first world. Instead of optimizing solely for traditional SEO, this tool examines signals that make a site accessible, structured and trustworthy for AI agents. It will crawl the target site, evaluate multiple factors and return a score along with actionable recommendations.  \n\n## Scoring rubric (example)  \n\nThe score is a weighted combination of factors such as:  \n\n- **Content structure (25%)** – presence of semantic HTML5 tags (header, nav, main, article, footer), schema.org structured data, and accessible ARIA labels.  \n- **Metadata quality (20%)** – descriptive page titles, meta descriptions, robots/meta tags, canonical links.  \n- **Page performance (15%)** – page load speed, responsive design, core web vitals.  \n- **Crawlability (15%)** – robots.txt configuration, sitemap.xml availability, HTTP status codes.  \n- **Freshness & updates (10%)** – frequency of content updates and content age.  \n- **AI friendliness (15%)** – clarity of content, avoidance of keyword stuffing, presence of Q&A sections or FAQs that LLMs can ingest.  \n\nThis rubric is preliminary and will evolve.  \n\n## Architecture Overview  \n\n- **Backend** – Python FastAPI service that accepts URLs, crawls pages, computes metrics and stores scores in a database. Uses requests and BeautifulSoup or Playwright for crawling.  \n- **Worker** – asynchronous job runner for crawling large sites and updating scores at regular intervals (e.g., Celery + Redis, or background tasks in FastAPI).  \n- **Frontend** – a React/Next.js dashboard where users can submit websites, view scores, and see recommendations. Supports multi tenant use for agencies managing several clients.  \n- **Database** – store site records, individual page metrics and historical scores (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite for MVP).  \n\n## Getting Started  \n\nIn the early phases we will prioritise building the backend skeleton:  \n\n1. Set up a FastAPI application with endpoints such as `/scan` to trigger a crawl and return a score.  \n2. Implement a simple crawler using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch pages and extract signals.  \n3. Compute a basic score using the rubric above and return recommendations.  \n4. Persist results into a simple storage (in‑memory or SQLite) for demonstration.  \n\nSubsequent phases will add the worker for scheduled rescans, refine the scoring algorithm, add user authentication, and develop the Next.js frontend.  \n\n## Contributing  \n\nPull requests and feedback are welcome. Please open an issue to propose changes to the scoring rubric or architecture.
